# Leadership, Culture and Diversity

## Servant Leadership

A Servant Leader is one who helps their teams to perform at their best by ensuring that the business outcomes are clearly understood, allowing the teams to define how they deliver those outcomes within the set guidelines. A Servant Leader should support their  teams by unblocking issues and offering strategic advice and guidance and  balancing delegation and accountability.

## Leadership and Culture

Leadership and culture in organisations refer to the role leadership plays in an organisation's culture. It refers to how leaders interact with one another and their team members. It's the way leaders operate, communicate, and make decisions. And it's about the everyday working environment: their behaviors, interactions, beliefs, and values.

No matter how great a company's organisational culture may be, its objectives and goals may remain unachieved without the influence of good leadership. A leader is anyone who has the authority or ability to influence and motivate others, irrespective of their title. They embody and reinforce the company's visions and set the rules with which the company work.

An organisation's culture comes from the values and practices that guide the decisions of the company. It's a collection of a company's objectives and mission that guides the actions and behaviours of the employer and their employees. Leadership and culture in organisations promote a positive atmosphere in the workplace, improves the performance of employees and can help the general success of the business.

Achieving a company's goals and objectives depends on its leadership and organisational culture. The presence of strong leadership helps employees carry out different activities efficiently and effectively. Understanding how leadership affects organisational culture can influence your company's productivity and how you collaborate with your team members. 

It's also the responsibility of leaders to define the company's ethics and beliefs while teaching the employees how to live by these values. Ethical leaders promote a culture of trust, integrity, honesty and fairness. They work to establish the organisation's core values and show employees what the management expects of them. People in leadership roles influence the organisational culture of the company, positively or negatively.

## How does leadership influence organisational culture

Leaders can educate employees on the company's organisational culture through their interactions. Both action and inaction go a long way in showing employees which actions and behaviour are acceptable or unacceptable in the company. Below are influences of leadership on culture in organisations:

### Reinforces accountability:

Accountability in the workplace is a major influencer of organisational structure. Leaders often make the rules and policies that guide a company, but holding employees accountable for their actions keeps them responsible and able to perform their tasks effectively. Good leaders build a culture of accountability when they clearly outline the responsibilities of employees and the standards by which they measure their success. Doing this gives employees a clear picture of the results the employers want them to achieve and motivates them to achieve and even exceed these expectations.

### Helps employees understand their roles and skills:

Outstanding leaders help employees to understand their assigned tasks and design a working strategy that allows them to execute their duties effectively. They help employees broaden their knowledge of their responsibilities and help to improve their skill sets. This may require additional training of team members in a particular department or cross-training of employees from different departments to increase their knowledge and strengthen their bonds.

### Fosters effective communication:

To be efficient and productive, it's important that employees understand their assigned responsibilities and the company's core values.

Good leaders possess great communication skills which enable them to communicate business targets while also actively listening to the challenges the workforce face. 
Effective communication can benefit a company in a number of ways. These include:

	•	strengthening the relationship of employers and employees alike
  
	•	increasing employee productivity
  
	•	better financial results
  
	•	improved employee satisfaction

### Promotes a common vision:

An organisation's vision often determines the company's future. Leaders create this vision and come up with strategies and methods to fulfil it. One approach is to teach employees about the company's goals and objectives and communicate ways to reach those targets. This information lets the team members know the company's current and future targets, how it intends to achieve them and the roles they can play to help accomplish these goals. This knowledge encourages employees to be more productive, as they can see first-hand how their efforts influence the success of the business.

### Promotes a learning culture:

Good leaders are always in the habit of sharing any information and knowledge that can promote the growth of their team members. They understand that employees need the necessary tools to work effectively. For employees to benefit the company, leadership needs to communicate and provide these tools effectively.

For example, you can organise monthly or yearly skill enhancement programmes for your team members aimed at enhancing their knowledge and increasing their technical capabilities. eg -Engineering Council forums, attending meet ups , conferences and networking.

### Fosters a culture of recognition and appreciation:

As a leader, you can promote a culture of recognition by encouraging and rewarding employees who work effectively and efficiently.
You can also recognise and appreciate an employee for their unique contributions towards a project and encourage other team members to do likewise. Employers who work in this kind of environment feel more fulfilled and motivated to carry out their tasks.

### Defines and reveals the company's core values:

Effective leadership often involves working hard to share and teach team members about the company's values and principles.

### Promotes job satisfaction:

When employees feel satisfied with their work, they become inspired to devote their time and skills towards the success of the business. Employees feel satisfied in jobs where they feel comfortable and their employers appreciate them. Different factors may influence an employee's job satisfaction, such as compensation, company's core values, promotion, quality of leadership, work environment and motivation. Effective leadership evaluates these factors to determine how they're able to satisfy the needs of their team members. 

### Defines the behaviour of employees:

Quality leaders lead by example. They understand that employees are looking up to them to know the acceptable ways of doing things in the organisation such as fulfilling their responsibilities, reacting to situations and handling projects. Therefore, effective leaders not only create company policies and rules but also live by them.
A good leader does not overlook mistakes but acknowledges them while offering directions and ways to improve. By working to embody the company's values, a good leader's behaviour and work ethic stand as models of what the company represents and stands for. With time, this begins to influence and define the behaviour of the workforce as they realise the correlation between the success of the business and their attitude.

### Boosts employee morale:

The best leaders find ways to motivate their team members and make their contributions feel valued. This includes praising and complimenting them, trusting in them and actively involving them in company decisions. Employees who work in this kind of atmosphere often feel more motivated to put in their best towards the company's growth and success.

## Implementing SAFe Lean Agile Development

SAFe emphasizes the values of autonomous, self-organisng, cross-functional teams and Agile Release Trains.
This supports a leaner management infrastructure, with more empowered individuals and teams and faster, 
local decision making. Taditional, day-to-day employee instructions and activity  direction is no longer required.

However, all employees  still need someone to assist them with career development, set and manage expectations
and provide the active coaching they need to advance their technical, functional, individual and team 
skills and career goals.  They also have a right to serve as an integral member of a high performing team.

Self organising ARTs do not fund themselves or define their own mission. That remains a management responsibility,
as it is an element of implementation of a  strategy.

## DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act)

DORA ensures a consistent provision of services across the entire value chain by introducing an end-to-end holistic framework for effective Risk management, ICT and cyber security operational capabilities, and Third Party management.

It aims to ensure that all participants in the financial system have the necessary safeguards in place to mitigate cyber-attacks and other risks. The legislation will require firms to ensure that they can withstand all types of ICT-related disruptions and threats.

The legislation is designed to improve the cybersecurity and operational resiliency of the financial services sector. It complements existing laws such as the Network and Information Security Directive (NISD) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).


## Becoming a better Boss

There are no quick “hacks” to being a good leader, but there are some easy steps you can take as early as today on your path to leadership excellence.

### See the Human
“Know Your Marines and look out for their welfare” is an official Marine Corps Leadership principle because knowing someone is critical for leading them.

It’s easy to fall into the mode of seeing your team as a single unit and forgetting it’s made up of very different parts.

You don’t need to be a rapid social chameleon to address different personalities and you must stay authentic to who you are — but you can adapt your ways to effectively address the unique personality standing in front of you.

Even a simple “how are you doing?” then truly caring about the answer goes a long way.

This starts by always looking at people as a unique individual first.

### Spare the Messenger

I’ve had some bosses that people would hide things from as much as possible just to make our work environment less toxic.

If someone on your team always regrets bringing you problems, they’ll stop bringing you problems.

Be patient with the messenger of bad news or challenges. Thank them for bringing it to your attention. Practice emotional restraint when the tides of emotions rise under your collar.

Because if your people get nothing but wrath and headaches when they share challenges with you, they’ll start hiding them.

“The day soldiers stop bringing you their problems is the day you have stopped leading them. They have either lost confidence that you can help them or concluded that you do not care. Either case is a failure of leadership.” — General Colin Powell


### Get Out of the Way

My favorite piece of leadership wisdom was shared by my old boss when he retired:

“Get out of your people’s way.”


I wish this was carved in stone over the entrance to every business school. People simply want to be able to operate without you being an obstacle.

Instead, clear an obstacle for them today, even if that obstacle has been you.

Of course, you must guide and direct and ensure the right “product” is seeing the light of day, and some people do need extra attention, but always tip the balance to less control over more if you want a happier human on your team.

“Go for it! Let me know if you need anything!” is like ear candy to any employee who cares about their work.

### Get Your Hands Dirty (as a Helper)

I love the story about the old man who jumped off his horse to help American Revolutionary War soldiers build their defenses. He jumped in and helped in the hard and dirty work right alongside them. They were just glad the old man was helping.

Above them, a Corporal barked orders to hurry up.

When they were done, the old man thanked the soldiers for their hard work and walked up to the Corporal and said:

‘The next time your rank prevents you from supporting your own men you should notify top command — and I will provide a more permanent solution.’

The Corporal turned white and saluted as he realized he had been speaking to none other than the Commander of the entire Continental Army…General George Washington.

A leader should never be too important to be a silent laborer of “dirty work,” and a follower of those they lead, when the team simply needs more hands.

### Prune Something

You know that little problem you’ve been putting off resolving?

Just do it. Get it off your desk before it grows.

Like weeds, most problems or issues don’t die on their own, they just keep growing in different directions if you don’t cut them off at the root.

Prune problems early so they don’t overtake your environment someday.

An old farmer I used to know used to joke “don’t do today what you can put off until tomorrow.” Who knows, maybe he had it all figured out — or he was a farmer of weeds.

But in my experience, it’s always best to nip problems in the bud.

### Project Positive

Anyone in a leadership role has an emotional effect on those they lead.

‘If Momma ain’t happy, ain’t nobody happy’ is now backed by science.

You always have a choice in the attitude and intensity of the emotions you display and there’s usually a better way than just letting your human nature take over.

Self-control often enables you to harness emotion into something positive and productive rather than negative and destructive.

### Take the Afternoon Off (Work life ballance)

Taking time for you shows the team it’s OK for them to take time for themselves.

This is better for them than dealing with the unspoken pressure put on them when you work all night and all weekend.

Plus, they could probably use a break from you even if you are a good boss!

So set the example of self-care by bugging out today!
