# Leadership, Culture and Diversity

### Who is a Servant Leader

A Servant Leader is one who helps their teams to perform at their best by ensuring that the business outcomes are clearly understood, allowing the teams to define how they deliver those outcomes within the set guidelines. A Servant Leader should support their teams by unblocking issues and offering strategic advice, guidance, balancing delegation and accountability.

### What is the role of Leadership and Culture 

Leadership and Culture in organisations refer to the role leadership plays in shaping an organisation's culture.

### What is an Organisation's Culture

It is the values and practices that guide the decisions of the company 

Furthermore, It's a collection of a company's objectives and mission that guides the actions and behaviours of the employer and their employees.

### What is the result of strong Leadership?

The presence of strong leadership helps employees carry out different activities efficiently and effectively.

### Who defines ethics and beliefs?

It's also the responsibility of leaders to define the company's ethics and beliefs while teaching the employees how to live by these values. Ethical leaders promote a culture of trust (through active listening, confidentiality and taking interest in what other people do), integrity, honesty and fairness. They work to establish the organisation's core values and show employees what the management expects of them.

## How does leadership influence organisational culture

Leaders can educate employees on the company's organisational culture through their INTERACTION. Both their action and inaction go a long way in showing employees which actions and behaviour are acceptable or unacceptable in the company. Below are influences of leadership on culture in organisations:

### Reinforces accountability:

Accountability in the workplace is a major influencer of organisational structure. Leaders often make the rules and policies that guide a company, but holding employees accountable for their actions keeps them responsible and able to perform their tasks effectively. Good leaders build a culture of accountability when they clearly outline the responsibilities of employees and the standards by which they measure their success. Doing this gives employees a clear picture of the results the employers want them to achieve and motivates them to achieve and even exceed these expectations.

### Helps employees understand their roles and skills:

Outstanding leaders help employees to understand their assigned tasks and design a working strategy that allows them to execute their duties effectively. They help employees broaden their knowledge of their responsibilities and help to improve their skill sets. This may require additional training of team members in a particular department or cross-training of employees from different departments to increase their knowledge and strengthen their bonds.

### Fosters effective communication:

To be efficient and productive, it's important that employees understand their assigned responsibilities and the company's core values.

Good leaders possess great communication skills which enable them to communicate business targets while also actively listening to the challenges the workforce face. 
Effective communication can benefit a company in a number of ways. These include:

	•	strengthening the relationship of employers and employees alike
  
	•	increasing employee productivity
  
	•	better financial results
  
	•	improved employee satisfaction

### Promotes a common vision:

An organisation's vision often determines the company's future. Leaders create this vision and come up with strategies and methods to fulfil it. One approach is to teach employees about the company's goals and objectives and communicate ways to reach those targets. This information lets the team members know the company's current and future targets, how it intends to achieve them and the roles they can play to help accomplish these goals. This knowledge encourages employees to be more productive, as they can see first-hand how their efforts influence the success of the business.

### Promotes a learning culture:

Good leaders are always in the habit of sharing any information and knowledge that can promote the growth of their team members. They understand that employees need the necessary tools to work effectively. For employees to benefit the company, leadership needs to communicate and provide these tools effectively.

For example, you can organise monthly or yearly skill enhancement programmes (SEP), Away Days for your team members aimed at enhancing their knowledge and increasing their technical capabilities. eg -Engineering Council forums, attending meet ups , conferences and networking.

### Fosters a culture of recognition and appreciation:

As a leader, you can promote a culture of recognition by encouraging and rewarding employees who work effectively and efficiently (E/E).
You can also recognise and appreciate an employee for their unique contributions towards a project and encourage other team members to do likewise. Employees  who work in this kind of environment feel more fulfilled and motivated to carry out their tasks.

### Defines and reveals the company's core values:

Effective leadership often involves working hard to share and teach team members about the company's values and principles.

### Promotes job satisfaction:

When employees feel satisfied with their work, they become inspired to devote their time and skills towards the success of the business. Employees feel satisfied in jobs where they feel comfortable and their employers appreciate them. Different factors may influence an employee's job satisfaction, such as compensation, company's core values, promotion, quality of leadership, work environment and motivation. Effective leadership evaluates these factors to determine how they're able to satisfy the needs of their team members. 

 - Also see Fosters effective communication: (above)

### Leading by example:

Quality leaders lead by example. They understand that employees are looking up to them to know the acceptable ways of doing things in the organisation such as fulfilling their responsibilities, reacting to situations and handling projects. Therefore, effective leaders not only create company policies and rules but also live by them.
A good leader does not overlook mistakes but acknowledges them while offering directions and ways to improve. By working to embody the company's values, a good leader's behaviour and work ethic stand as models of what the company represents and stands for. With time, this begins to influence and define the behaviour of the workforce as they realise the correlation between the success of the business and their attitude.

### Boosts employee morale:

The best leaders find ways to motivate their team members and make their contributions feel valued. This includes praising and complimenting them, trusting in them and actively involving them in company decisions. Employees who work in this kind of atmosphere often feel more motivated to put in their best towards the company's growth and success.

## Diversity

By Diversity, we mean empowering people by respecting and appreciating what makes them different, in terms of age, gender, ethnicity, religion, disability, sexual orientation, education, and national origin. 

### Building an inclusive workplace

- Foster diversity

- Educate Leadership

- Get the entire team involved in inclusion, and form an inclusion council.

- Put your mission in writing. 

- Celebrate employee differences.

- Establish a program or committee dedicated to inclusion, and hold more efficient meetings.

- Listen to Employees.

- Focus on culture add, and not culture fit always.

- Communicate goals and measure progress.
.
### Ways to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace

- Be aware of unconscious bias.

- Communicate the importance of managing bias.

- Promote pay equity.

- Develop a strategic training program.

- Acknowledge holidays of all cultures.

- Make it easy for your people to participate in employee resource groups.

- Mix up your teams.


## Implementing SAFe Lean Agile Development

SAFe emphasizes the values of autonomous, self-organisng, cross-functional teams and Agile Release Trains.
This supports a leaner management infrastructure, with more empowered individuals and teams and faster, 
local decision making. Taditional, day-to-day employee instructions and activity  direction is no longer required.

It is also about managing a balancing act of delegation and accountability to be efficient with team management.

However, all employees  still need someone to assist them with career development, set and manage expectations
and provide the active coaching they need to advance their technical, functional, individual and team 
skills and career goals.  They also have a right to serve as an integral member of a high performing team.

Self organising ARTs do not fund themselves or define their own mission. That remains a management responsibility,
as it is an element of implementation of a  strategy.

## DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act)

DORA ensures a consistent provision of services across the entire value chain by introducing an end-to-end holistic framework for effective Risk management, ICT and cyber security operational capabilities, and Third Party management.

It aims to ensure that all participants in the financial system have the necessary safeguards in place to mitigate cyber-attacks and other risks. The legislation will require firms to ensure that they can withstand all types of ICT-related disruptions and threats.

The legislation is designed to improve the cybersecurity and operational resiliency of the financial services sector. It complements existing laws such as the Network and Information Security Directive (NISD) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).


## Becoming a better Boss

There are no quick “hacks” to being a good leader, but there are some easy steps you can take as early as today on your path to leadership excellence.

### See the Human
“Know Your Marines and look out for their welfare” is an official Marine Corps Leadership principle because knowing someone is critical for leading them.

It’s easy to fall into the mode of seeing your team as a single unit and forgetting it’s made up of very different parts.

You don’t need to be a rapid social chameleon to address different personalities and you must stay authentic to who you are — but you can adapt your ways to effectively address the unique personality standing in front of you.

Even a simple “how are you doing?” then truly caring about the answer goes a long way.

This starts by always looking at people as a unique individual first.

### Spare the Messenger

I’ve had some bosses that people would hide things from as much as possible just to make our work environment less toxic.

If someone on your team always regrets bringing you problems, they’ll stop bringing you problems.

Be patient with the messenger of bad news or challenges. Thank them for bringing it to your attention. Practice emotional restraint when the tides of emotions rise under your collar.

Because if your people get nothing but wrath and headaches when they share challenges with you, they’ll start hiding them.

“The day soldiers stop bringing you their problems is the day you have stopped leading them. They have either lost confidence that you can help them or concluded that you do not care. Either case is a failure of leadership.” — General Colin Powell


### Get Out of the Way

My favorite piece of leadership wisdom was shared by my old boss when he retired:

“Get out of your people’s way.”


I wish this was carved in stone over the entrance to every business school. People simply want to be able to operate without you being an obstacle.

Instead, clear an obstacle for them today, even if that obstacle has been you.

Of course, you must guide and direct and ensure the right “product” is seeing the light of day, and some people do need extra attention, but always tip the balance to less control over more if you want a happier human on your team.

“Go for it! Let me know if you need anything!” is like ear candy to any employee who cares about their work.

### Get Your Hands Dirty (as a Helper)

I love the story about the old man who jumped off his horse to help American Revolutionary War soldiers build their defenses. He jumped in and helped in the hard and dirty work right alongside them. They were just glad the old man was helping.

Above them, a Corporal barked orders to hurry up.

When they were done, the old man thanked the soldiers for their hard work and walked up to the Corporal and said:

‘The next time your rank prevents you from supporting your own men you should notify top command — and I will provide a more permanent solution.’

The Corporal turned white and saluted as he realized he had been speaking to none other than the Commander of the entire Continental Army…General George Washington.

A leader should never be too important to be a silent laborer of “dirty work,” and a follower of those they lead, when the team simply needs more hands.

### Prune Something

You know that little problem you’ve been putting off resolving?

Just do it. Get it off your desk before it grows.

Like weeds, most problems or issues don’t die on their own, they just keep growing in different directions if you don’t cut them off at the root.

Prune problems early so they don’t overtake your environment someday.

An old farmer I used to know used to joke “don’t do today what you can put off until tomorrow.” Who knows, maybe he had it all figured out — or he was a farmer of weeds.

But in my experience, it’s always best to nip problems in the bud.

### Project Positive

Anyone in a leadership role has an emotional effect on those they lead.

‘If Momma ain’t happy, ain’t nobody happy’ is now backed by science.

You always have a choice in the attitude and intensity of the emotions you display and there’s usually a better way than just letting your human nature take over.

Self-control often enables you to harness emotion into something positive and productive rather than negative and destructive.

### Take the Afternoon Off (Work life ballance)

Taking time for you shows the team it’s OK for them to take time for themselves.

This is better for them than dealing with the unspoken pressure put on them when you work all night and all weekend.

Plus, they could probably use a break from you even if you are a good boss!

So set the example of self-care by bugging out today! 



##  How long should a sprint planning meeting last?

In your experience, how long should a Sprint Planning meeting (Scrum) last? 8 hours? Or should it be shorter (succinct) and further discussions should be planned as part of the sprint? Our Sprints are 10 days long.

```

8 hours per a 10 day sprint definitely sounds too much to me. Discussions which don't require the whole team should be taken out into separate sessions, only for the members involved

```

So you plan other meetings instead of discussing everything in the planning?

```
Discussions should happen about upcoming ideas and plans so that most team members have some basic and shared understanding about them. The criterion is this: during the planning meeting, nobody should be surprised because of hearing a certain thing for the first time. Whenever such "surprise" happens, adjust by increasing the amount of communication that happens before the next planning meeting. (Exceptions to this are truly groundbreaking announcements coming from project owners.) 

```

According to the Scrum Guide:

```
The Sprint Planning Meeting is time-boxed to eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is proportionately shorter. For example, two-week Sprints have four-hour Sprint Planning Meetings.

```

```

Probably a good starting point, but it should also be noted that you do need to tailor the process to your project, team, and organization so that it works for you. Just because other people have had luck with it doesn't mean it will work for you right out of the box. – Thomas Owens♦ Sep 13 '11 at 20:21


However, if you're going to try Scrum, you should probably try it based on the defined guidelines first. Then, if something isn't working, refine it. If you change the rules before you even start, you're disregarding the empirical evidence that made the folks who devised Scrum recommend what they recommended--without any empirical evidence to show that that's the wrong thing for you.


```

In my team of 3, we usually only had half-hour long sprints, and when the team was 7, it was usually only an hour for two week long sprints

```

As long as it needs to last, no less and no more. Anything else isn't Agile.

```

If you have a team of 2 - 3 developers and are doing 1 week sprints anything more than a hour is probably counter productive.

If you have a team of 15 people and 2 weeks sprints you are looking at all day, anything less isn't detailed enough.

It takes experience to get it mostly right, and that is what retrospectives are for, the team decides what is too long or too short.

Don't worry about getting it perfect or sticking to what some book says, try something and refine it

```

SCRUM is about refining the process in iterations as much as it is about refining your code in iterations.

```

An hour seems a bit short for 3 developers / 1 week sprints. Then again, I just finished a relatively small project where we did a 5-minute weekly sprint planning. It depends on the project, and on the cards, because sometimes more (or less) discussion is needed during sprint planning.

One of the key ideas of Scrum, as an Agile framework, is that you <i>time-box</i> activities, such as the sprint, the sprint planning meeting, and the daily stand-up/scrum. The point is to keep things focused. Time-boxing does not mean that you cannot take less time than is designated. Just that you should not take more, as that tends to make people lose focus and also reduces the amount of time the team has to actually do the work. 

```

Do not mold your business around the process. The process supports your business. The moment you're doing process for its own sake it's time for the process to get the axe. To that end, there is no "right" way. Meetings should only go as long as you are accomplishing something in them. If it takes you 30 minutes or 4 hours, as long as it works then go with it. Ignore what some book/blog/coach tells you and do what is right for you.


```

Why not start the process as designed and adapt from there? If you decide to use agile practices and haven't molded your business in that direction, you're already in trouble.


```
Take as long as you need so that you select enough that your team thinks they can reasonably achieve in the sprint. But you should be spending time during the (previous) sprint refining the backlog: estimating and refining stories.

```

###  Product Backlog Refinement

One of the lesser known, but valuable, guidelines in Scrum is that five or ten percent of each Sprint must be dedicated by the Team to refining (or “grooming”) the Product Backlog. This includes detailed requirements analysis, splitting large items into smaller ones, estimation of new items, and re-estimation of existing items. 

Scrum is silent on how this work is done, but a frequently used technique is a focused workshop near the end of the Sprint, so that the Team and Product Owner can dedicate themselves to this work without interruption. For a two-week Sprint, five percent of the duration implies that each Sprint there is a half-day Product Backlog Refinement workshop. 

This refinement activity is not for items selected for the current Sprint; it is for items for the future, most likely in the next one or two Sprints. With this practice, Sprint Planning becomes relatively simple because the Product Owner and Scrum Team start the planning with a clear, well-analyzed and carefully estimated set of items. A sign that this refinement workshop is not being done (or not being done well) is that Sprint Planning involves significant questions, discovery, or confusion and feels incomplete; planning work then often spills over into the Sprint itself, which is typically not desirable.

```

Doing this means you can focus on planning during planning, and it doesn't take all day and the team starts to lose focus and get bored.

```

### Duration

In Scrum, when working to 2 week sprints, the sprint planning is time-boxed at 4 hours, making it a half day event. One reason for the relatively large amount of time is that the development team must be able to confidently agree that all items being pulled into the sprint backlog can be delivered, which means they need to know the detail. It is not uncommon as part of sprint planning for teams to break off from the meeting space for periods of time in order to investigate items further and ensure that they are "Ready" to go into the sprint backlog. (It can help to think of sprint planning as an event, rather than a meeting.)

Use your "Definition of Ready" and the length of time that the sprint planning event allows to ensure that all backlog items going into the sprint are both feasible and ready. i.e. They can be done (completely, as per "Definition of Done") within the sprint, and there is enough information for the team to be able to do them right now.
Note of course that you probably don't want to be doing this for ALL items during the sprint planning, as it can be very time consuming. Do try and have regular backlog grooming (outwith sprint planning) where you can breakdown backlog items, and estimate items not yet estimated using planning poker for example. (I've found this can be a effective activity for over a working dinner with the development team, should you have the luxury of your team's availability at dinner time!)

High priority items can often be added to the product backlog by the product owner just prior to sprint planning though, and whilst routine backlog grooming can, and normally should, be done before the sprint planning event, there will always be new items like this where the team needs to spend time working out the detail and estimating complexity during the sprint planning event, hence why it can stretch to 4 hours for 10 day/2 week sprints.

If you need to take longer discussions out of this event, then you might have a backlog item in the sprint backlog to "have such and such a discussion to establish x", but you should avoid including sprint items to do whatever you are going to determine needs done during that discussion, as those are not "ready" backlog items to go into the sprint.

As people have said, there are reasons you might want to change the way you run Scrum if the process isn't working effectively for you. Scrum is however, a very well thought out and tested framework to start with so I would make sure your reasoning is justified before changing the process.


### The SPRINT agenda

In the Sprint Planning Meeting, the team has to determine two sets of things:

``` 

A) What will be developed by the team during this Sprint

B) How it will be developed

```

This meeting must be time-boxed, up to two hours for each week of the Sprint, split evenly for each part (part A and Part B) of the meeting.

So, for a Sprint of 4 weeks, this meeting should be no longer than 8 hours, up to 4 hours for part A and up to 4 hours for part B.

During part A, the dev team has to estimate the team velocity that they consider they will have during this Sprint. They also have to estimate the top priority user stories, and choose enough of these (already estimated) user stories to complete in line with their own estimated team velocity.

In part B, the dev team will discuss how to develop the more challenging user stories already selected to be developed. Most probably, the dev team will not have enough time to discuss how to develop all the selected user stories, so, the team has to choose the most challenging user stories.

During the Sprint, the dev team has enough time to complete this discussion.
