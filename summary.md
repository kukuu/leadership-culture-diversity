# Summary, Leadership, Culture and Diversity

### Who is a Servant Leader
A Servant Leader is one who helps their teams to perform at their best by ensuring that the business outcomes are clearly understood, allowing the teams to define how they deliver those outcomes within the set guidelines. A Servant Leader should support their teams by unblocking issues and offering strategic advice and guidance and balancing delegation and accountability.

### What is the role of Leadership and Culture

Leadership and Culture in organisations refer to the role leadership plays in shaping an organisation's culture.

### What is an Organisation's Culture

It is the values and practices that guide the decisions of the company 

Furthermore, It's a collection of a company's objectives and mission that guides the actions and behaviours of the employer and their employees.

### What is the outcome of strong Leadership?

The presence of strong leadership helps employees carry out different activities efficiently and effectively.

### Who defines ethics and beliefs?

It's also the responsibility of leaders to define the company's ethics and beliefs while teaching the employees how to live by these values. Ethical leaders promote a culture of trust, integrity, honesty and fairness. They work to establish the organisation's core values and show employees what the management expects of them.

## How does leadership influence organisational culture
Leaders can educate employees on the company's organisational culture through their interactions. 

### Reinforces accountability:

#### What do Accountability Leaders often do and ensure? 
Accountability Leaders often make the rules and policies that guide a company, but holding employees accountable for their actions keeps them responsible and able to perform their tasks effectively.

#### How do you build a Culture of Accountability?
Good leaders build a culture of accountability when they clearly outline the responsibilities of employees and the standards by which they measure their success. 

#### What is the outcome of building a good Leadership and Culture?
Doing this gives employees a clear picture of the results the employers want them to achieve and motivates them to achieve and even exceed these expectations.

### Helps employees understand their roles and skills

#### What do outstanding leaders do to be understood by employees?
By assigning tasks and designing a working strategy and framework that allows them to execute their duties effectively. 

#### Secondly, they help employees broaden their knowledge of their responsibilities and help to improve their skill sets. This may require additional training of team members in a particular department or cross-training of employees from different departments to increase their knowledge and strengthen their bonds.

### Fosters effective communication
Good leaders possess great communication skills which enable them to communicate business targets while also actively listening to the challenges the workforce faces. Effective communication can benefit a company in a number of ways. These include:

- strengthening the relationship of employers and employees alike

- increasing employee productivity

- better financial results

- improved employee satisfaction



### Defines the behaviour of employees - Leading by example:

- They understand that employees are looking up to them to know the acceptable ways of doing things in the organisation such as fulfilling their responsibilities, reacting to situations and handling projects.

- A good leader does not overlook mistakes but acknowledges them while offering directions and ways to improve.
Therefore, effective leaders not only create company policies and rules but also live by them.  By working to embody the company's values, a good leader's behaviour and work ethic stand as models of what the company represents and stands for. 

- With time, this begins to influence and define the behaviour of the workforce as they realise the correlation between the success of the business and their attitude.

### Promotes a common vision:
An organisation's vision often determines the company's future. Leaders create this vision and come up with strategies and methods to fulfil it. One approach is to teach employees about the company's goals and objectives and communicate ways to reach those targets. This information lets the team members know the company's current and future targets, how it intends to achieve them and the roles they can play to help accomplish these goals. This knowledge encourages employees to be more productive, as they can see first-hand how their efforts influence the success of the business.

### Promotes job satisfaction:
When employees feel satisfied with their work, they become inspired to devote their time and skills towards the success of the business. Employees feel satisfied in jobs where they feel comfortable and their employers appreciate them. 

Different factors may influence an employee's job satisfaction, such as:

- compensation
- the company's core values
- promotion
- quality of leadership
- work environment and motivation.
- Effective leadership evaluates these factors to determine how they're able to satisfy the needs of their team members.

### Promotes a learning culture:
Good leaders are always in the habit of sharing any information and knowledge that can promote the growth of their team members. They understand that employees need the necessary tools to work effectively. For employees to benefit the company, leadership needs to communicate and provide these tools effectively.

For example, you can organise monthly or yearly skill enhancement programmes for your team members aimed at enhancing their knowledge and increasing their technical capabilities. eg -Engineering Council forums, attending meet ups , conferences and networking.

### Fosters a culture of recognition and appreciation:
As a leader, you can promote a culture of recognition by encouraging and rewarding employees who work effectively and efficiently. You can also recognise and appreciate an employee for their unique contributions towards a project and encourage other team members to do likewise. Employers who work in this kind of environment feel more fulfilled and motivated to carry out their tasks.

### Boosts employee morale:
The best leaders find ways to motivate their team members and make their contributions feel valued. This includes praising and complimenting them, trusting in them and actively involving them in company decisions. Employees who work in this kind of atmosphere often feel more motivated to put in their best towards the company's growth and success.

## Influencing
Effective leaders don’t just command; they inspire, persuade, and encourage. Leaders tap the knowledge and skills of a group, point individuals toward a common goal, and draw out a commitment to achieve results.

To influence one needs to be clear about own goals, values, assertive and have a dynamic model to meet the challenges of the technology changing market. This requires an aggregation of a network of skills, a dynamic model and flexible governance.

The goal is to influence others, not manipulate them. Effective, ethical leaders use different approaches in different situations. Leaders need to understand why they are doing something, and be clear about their own values and goals when applying their influence skills. Influencing then comes from a place of authenticity and has the greatest impact.

#### How to influence
- Positive Self promotion - Gravitas
- 
In the hands of an astute leader, self-promotion isn’t just a tool to advance one’s own career. It can provide visibility and opportunities for their direct reports, generate team and organizational pride, and make capabilities and ideas more visible across the organization — ultimately enhancing collaboration.

Two self-promotion strategies stand out. First, leaders who are good at this skill find ways to gather an audience. They may ask more people to be part of a team, initiative, or problem-solving process. Second, self-promoters find ways to “put on a show.” Leaders find ways to step into the spotlight at selected events and meetings, sometimes creating their own events.

- Networking
- 
Leaders who are skilled at influencing others recognize and cultivate the power of networks. Organizations are increasingly dynamic; they morph in size and shape over time. Influential leaders recognize that their personal networks must also be dynamic, and they continually grow and strengthen their networks. They are also strategic about choosing how and when to tap into this network.

- Building and Maintaining a Foundation of Trust
  
Because leadership so often involves guiding people through risk and change, trust is essential. Building and maintaining trust is essential for leading. Without trust, leaders may be able to force people to comply, but they’ll never tap the full commitment, capabilities, and creativity the group can offer. Leveraging these assets is invaluable when tackling tough challenges or making strategic change, so trust is vital.

People look for leaders who can appreciate their vulnerability and inspire them, understand them, contribute to their self development, support them, and guide them through looming chaos. This requires the leader to demonstrate a broad range of behaviors, some of which might seem contradictory but when used in an appropriate and timely manner, create conditions that foster trust.

Trust involves a careful balance between pushing people into areas where they’re uncomfortable through challenges, while also listening carefully to their concerns and feedback.

Among the many “balancing acts” they must work to maintain, trustworthy leaders weigh toughness and empathy as individuals struggle with transition as well as urgency with patience as change proceeds. 
Showing a degree of emotional intelligence.



## Diversity
By Diversity, we mean empowering people by respecting and appreciating what makes them different, in terms of age, gender, ethnicity, religion, disability, sexual orientation, education, and national origin.

### Building an inclusive workplace

- Foster diversity

- Educate Leadership

- Get the entire team involved in inclusion, and form an inclusion council.

- Put your mission in writing.

- Celebrate employee differences.

- Establish a program or committee dedicated to inclusion, and hold more efficient meetings.

- Listen to Employees.

- Focus on culture add, and not culture fit always.

- Communicate goals and measure progress. 

### Ways to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace

- Be aware of unconscious bias.

- Communicate the importance of managing bias.

- Promote pay equity.

- Develop a strategic training program.

## Implementing SAFe Lean Agile Development

SAFe emphasizes the values of autonomous, self-organisng, cross-functional teams and Agile Release Trains. This supports a leaner management infrastructure, with more empowered individuals and teams and faster, local decision making. Taditional, day-to-day employee instructions and activity direction is no longer required.

It is also about managing a balancing act of delegation and accountability to be efficient with team management.

However, all employees still need someone to assist them with career development, set and manage expectations and provide the active coaching they need to advance their technical, functional, individual and team skills and career goals. They also have a right to serve as an integral member of a high performing team.

Self organising ARTs do not fund themselves or define their own mission. That remains a management responsibility, as it is an element of implementation of a strategy.

## DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act)
DORA ensures a consistent provision of services (i.e Benchmarking DevOps, CI/CD) across the entire value chain by introducing an end-to-end holistic framework for effective Risk management, ICT and cyber security operational capabilities, and Third Party management.

It aims to ensure that all participants in the financial system have the necessary safeguards in place to mitigate cyber-attacks and other risks. The legislation will require firms to ensure that they can withstand all types of ICT-related disruptions and threats.

The legislation is designed to improve the cybersecurity and operational resiliency of the financial services sector. It complements existing laws such as the Network and Information Security Directive (NISD) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).



## Becoming a better Boss
There are no quick “hacks” to being a good leader, but there are some easy steps you can take as early as today on your path to leadership excellence.

- See the Human : Being empathetic
“Know Your Marines and look out for their welfare” is an official Marine Corps Leadership principle because knowing someone is critical for leading them.

It’s easy to fall into the mode of seeing your team as a single unit and forgetting it’s made up of very different parts.

You don’t need to be a rapid social chameleon to address different personalities and you must stay authentic to who you are — but you can adapt your ways to effectively address the unique personality standing in front of you.

Even a simple “how are you doing?” then truly caring about the answer goes a long way.

This starts by always looking at people as a unique individual first.

- Spare the Messenger
I’ve had some bosses that people would hide things from as much as possible just to make our work environment less toxic.

If someone on your team always regrets bringing you problems, they’ll stop bringing you problems.

Be patient with the messenger of bad news or challenges. Thank them for bringing it to your attention. Practice emotional restraint when the tides of emotions rise under your collar.

Because if your people get nothing but wrath and headaches when they share challenges with you, they’ll start hiding them.

“The day soldiers stop bringing you their problems is the day you have stopped leading them. They have either lost confidence that you can help them or concluded that you do not care. Either case is a failure of leadership.” — General Colin Powell

- Get Out of the Way: Be a Servant Leader and not an Obstacle: Ensure all bottlenecks are removed and the team has all needed tobe cross-functional
  
My favorite piece of leadership wisdom was shared by my old boss when he retired:

“Get out of your people’s way.”

I wish this was carved in stone over the entrance to every business school. People simply want to be able to operate without you being an obstacle.

Instead, clear an obstacle for them today, even if that obstacle has been you.

Of course, you must guide and direct and ensure the right “product” is seeing the light of day, and some people do need extra attention, but always tip the balance to less control over more if you want a happier human on your team.

“Go for it! Let me know if you need anything!” is like ear candy to any employee who cares about their work.

- Get Your Hands Dirty (as a Helper)
  
I love the story about the old man who jumped off his horse to help American Revolutionary War soldiers build their defenses. He jumped in and helped in the hard and dirty work right alongside them. They were just glad the old man was helping.

Above them, a Corporal barked orders to hurry up.

When they were done, the old man thanked the soldiers for their hard work and walked up to the Corporal and said:

‘The next time your rank prevents you from supporting your own men you should notify top command — and I will provide a more permanent solution.’

The Corporal turned white and saluted as he realized he had been speaking to none other than the Commander of the entire Continental Army…General George Washington.

A leader should never be too important to be a silent laborer of “dirty work,” and a follower of those they lead, when the team simply needs more hands.

- Prune Something
You know that little problem you’ve been putting off resolving?

Just do it. Get it off your desk before it grows.

Like weeds, most problems or issues don’t die on their own, they just keep growing in different directions if you don’t cut them off at the root.

Prune problems early so they don’t overtake your environment someday.

An old farmer I used to know used to joke “don’t do today what you can put off until tomorrow.” Who knows, maybe he had it all figured out — or he was a farmer of weeds.

But in my experience, it’s always best to nip problems in the bud.

- Project Positive
  
Anyone in a leadership role has an emotional effect on those they lead.

‘If Momma ain’t happy, ain’t nobody happy’ is now backed by science.

You always have a choice in the attitude and intensity of the emotions you display and there’s usually a better way than just letting your human nature take over.

Self-control often enables you to harness emotion into something positive and productive rather than negative and destructive.

- Take the Afternoon Off (Work life ballance)
  
Taking time for you shows the team it’s OK for them to take time for themselves.

This is better for them than dealing with the unspoken pressure put on them when you work all night and all weekend.

Plus, they could probably use a break from you even if you are a good boss!

So set the example of self-care by bugging out today!
